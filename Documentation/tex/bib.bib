abstract = {The well known theorem of G¨odel shows that every system of logic is in a certain sense incomplete, but at the same time it indicates means whereby from a system L of logic a more complete system L 0 may be obtained. By repeating the process we get a sequence L, L1 = L 0 , L2 = L1 0 , L3 = L2 0 ,. . . of logics each more complete than the preceding. A logic L$\omega$ may then be constructed in which the provable theorems are the totality of theorems provable with the help of the logics L, L1, L2,. . . We may then form L2$\omega$ related to L$\omega$ the same may as L$\omega$ was related to L. Proceeding in this may we can associate a system of logic with any given constructive ordinal1 . It may be asked whether a sequence of logics of this kind is complete in the sense that to any problem A there corresponds an ordinal $\alpha$ such that A is solvable by means of the logic L$\alpha$. I propose to investigate this problem in a rather more general case, and to give some other examples of ways in which systems of logic may be associated with constructive ordinals.},

@article{Shadbolt2009,
abstract = {The state of the art in human interaction with computational systems blurs the line between computations performed by machine logic and algorithms, and those that result from input by humans, arising from their own psychological processes and life experience. Current socio-technical systems, known as ‘social machines' exploit the large-scale interaction of humans with machines. Interactions that are motivated by numerous goals and purposes including financial gain, charitable aid, and simply for fun. In this paper we explore the landscape of social machines, both past and present, with the aim of defining an initial classificatory framework. Through a number of knowledge elicitation and refinement exercises we have identified the polyarchical relationship between infrastructure, social machines, and large-scale social initiatives. Our initial framework describes classification constructs in the areas of contributions, participants, and motivation. We present an initial characterization of some of the most popular social machines, as demonstration of the use of the identified constructs. We believe that it is important to undertake an analysis of the behaviour and phenomenology of social machines, and of their growth and evolution over time. Our future work will seek to elicit additional opinions, classifications and validation from a wider audience, to produce a comprehensive framework for the description, analysis and comparison of social machines.},

@article{Robertson2013,
abstract = {The aim of 'programming the global computer' was identified by Milner and others as one of the grand challenges of computing research. At the time this phrase was coined, it was natural to assume that this objective might be achieved primarily through extending programming and specification languages. The Internet, however, has brought with it a different style of computation that (although harnessing variants of traditional programming languages) operates in a style different to those with which we are familiar. The 'computer' on which we are running these computations is a social computer in the sense that many of the elementary functions of the computations it runs are performed by humans, and successful execution of a program often depends on properties of the human society over which the program operates. These sorts of programs are not programmed in a traditional way and may have to be understood in a way that is different from the traditional view of programming. This shift in perspective raises new challenges for the science of the Web and for computing in general.},
